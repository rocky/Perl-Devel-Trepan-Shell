=head1 NAME

An interactive shell command plugin for L<Devel::Trepan>

=head1 SUMMARY

This adds a "shell" command with alias "re.pl" to the
L<Devel::Trepan> debugger, I<trepan.pl>. The command goes into
a L<Devel::REPL> shell from inside the debugger.

But wait, there's more!

This package also contains some L<Devel::REPL> plugins for entering both the
Devel::Trepan debugger and the tried-and-true L<perl5db>.
debugger, from a I<re.pl> shell:

To call the debuggers inside I<re.pl>, first run or put in your 
I<~/.re.pl/rc.pl> file:

    $_REPL->load_plugin('Trepan');         # to go into the trepan debugger
    $_REPL->load_plugin('Perl5db');        # to go into the perl5db debugger

And then in your I<re.pl> session:

    %trepan Perl-expression-or-statement    # enter Devel::Trepan debugger
    %perl5db Perl-expression-or-statement   # enter Perl5db
