	* lib/Devel/REPL/Plugin/Trepan.pm, lib/Devel/Trepan/Shell.pm: 
	Trepan.pm: Make sure we switch back to Shell eval package context.

	* Build.PL, lib/Devel/REPL/Plugin/Trepan.pm: Trepan.pm: rough cut at

	lib/Devel/Trepan/CmdProcessor/Command/Shell.pm: Use % as escape

	can't create a second (nested) readline interface.

	* lib/Devel/Trepan/CmdProcessor/Command/Shell.pm: We can now run
	debugger commands from inside Devel::REPL.
