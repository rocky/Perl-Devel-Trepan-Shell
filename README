NAME
    An interactive shell command plugin for Devel::Trepan

SUMMARY
    This adds a "shell" command with alias "re.pl" to the Devel::Trepan
    debugger, trepan.pl. The command goes into a Devel::REPL shell from
    inside the debugger.

    But wait, there's more!

    This package also contains some Devel::REPL plugins for entering both
    the Devel::Trepan debugger and the tried-and-true perl5db. debugger,
    from a re.pl shell:

    To call the debuggers inside *re.pl*, first run or put in your
    ~/.re.pl/rc.p* file:

        $_REPL->load_plugin('Trepan');         # to go into the trepan debugger
        $_REPL->load_plugin('Perl5db');        # to go into the perl5db debugger

    And then in your *re.pl* session:

        %trepan Perl-expression-or-statement    # enter Devel::Trepan debugger
        %perl5db Perl-expression-or-statement   # enter Perl5db
