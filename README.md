Devel::Trepan::Shell -- interactive shell support for Devel::Trepan 
==================================================================

An interactive shell command for [Devel::Trepan](https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan/wiki).

Motivation: _Devel::Trepan_ is getting quite large and adding a shell
via _Devel::REPL_ pulls in lots of other packages. Thus we have this
separated this portion.

INSTALLATION
------------

To install this Devel::Trepan::Shell, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	make
	make test
	[sudo] make install
