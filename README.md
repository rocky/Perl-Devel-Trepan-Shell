Devel::Trepan::Shell -- interactive shell support for Devel::Trepan and more
==================================================================

An interactive shell command for [Devel::Trepan](https://github.com/rocky/Perl-Devel-Trepan/wiki).

Motivation: <i>Devel::Trepan</i> is getting quite large and adding a
shell via <i>Devel::REPL</i> pulls in lots of other packages. Thus we
have this separated this portion.

SYNOPSIS
--------

This adds a "shell" command with alias "re.pl" to the
<i>Devel::Trepan</i> debugger, <i>trepan.pl</i>. The command goes into
a <i>Devel::REPL</i> shell from inside the debugger.

But wait, there's more!

This package also contains some <i>Devel::REPL</i> plugins for entering both the
<i>Devel::Trepan</i> debugger and the tried-and-true <i>perl5db</i>
debuger, fom a <i>re.pl</i> shell:

To call the debuggers inside <i>re.pl<i>, first run (or put in your 
<i>~/.re.pl/rc.pl</i> file)

    $_REPL->load_plugin('Trepan');         # to go into the trepan debugger
    $_REPL->load_plugin('Perl5db');        # to go into the perl5db debugger

And then in your re.pl session:

    %trepan Perl-expression-or-statement    # enter Devel::Trepan debugger
    %perl5db Perl-expression-or-statement   # enter Perl5db
